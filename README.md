### Introduction ###
This plugin provides access to your channel PEAR library via Plex.

### Installation ###
1. Must have [Plex Media Server][GetPlex] installed
2. Must have a channel PEAR account with sources in your library
3. Download the archive and extract it to the Plex plugin folder, for more details read the [official channel installation guide](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-):
  * on Windows: *C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\*
  * on Mac: *~Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/*
  * on Linux: */usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Resources/Plug-ins* or */var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/*
  * on FreeBSD *usr/pbi/plexmediaserver-amd64/plexdata/Plex\ Media\ Server/Plug-ins/*
4. Rename folder from **channelpear.bundle-master** to **channelpear.bundle**
5. Restart Plex Media Server

### Change Settings ###
You must disable "Direct Play" and "Direct Stream" in your Plex Web settings under the "Player" category. (click "show advanced" if you can't see the options)

Doing this will allow you to stream from sources in a web browser that would otherwise fail due to crossdomain restrictions.

### Link your Library ###
Once you've installed the plugin successfully, you'll need to link it to your channel PEAR library. **The plugin will not work until you complete this step**. Go here for linking instructions: http://jidly.github.io/channelpear.bundle/

### Compatible devices ###
Streams **will play only on clients that are able to handle the stream natively**. Below is a list of devices that support playback to some extent:

* **Desktop Clients**:
  * **[Plex Media Center]** - plays most streams without problems
* **Connected Devices**:
  * **Plex for LG TV ([MediaLink])** plays HTTP and RTSP streams
